# The-Simple-Shop-2.0

## Introduction
The Simple Shop 2.0 is a robust library created to assist The Simple Shop GmbH in transitioning to an online retail platform. The aim is to craft a backend system that is not only versatile but also customizable to fit the diverse requirements of various shop owners.

## Progress Overview
Utilizing Java 17, we've built a solid core infrastructure, with Maven managing our dependencies and builds. The Spring Framework empowers us to support modern web applications and enhances our development process with its robust features.

## Core Features
We have successfully rolled out several key features, which include:

- **Product Catalog Management**: A service for managing product entries, backed by a PostgreSQL database and Spring Data JPA for efficient data interaction.
- **Shopping Cart Logic**: A session-based cart system that allows for an interactive shopping experience.
- **Basic Checkout Process**: An initial checkout system that processes user details and payment information.

## Technical Choices
The choice of PostgreSQL reflects our commitment to robustness and compatibility with enterprise-level applications, ensuring the project's longevity.

## Challenges Encountered
A major hurdle was to ensure the product catalog's adaptability with various storage solutions. This was overcome by implementing an abstract repository layer, allowing for seamless database integration without impacting the business logic.

## Current User Interface
Development of the user interface has commenced, featuring a Thymeleaf template for product addition. This integrates with a Spring MVC controller for processing form submissions and updating data in real-time.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
A rigorous testing protocol is in place, consisting of unit and integration tests, to affirm the application's reliability and stability.

## Next Steps
The immediate focus is to refine the checkout process, incorporating order history tracking. Subsequent enhancements will include robust security features for data protection.

## Conclusion
The Simple Shop 2.0 is on track to deliver a comprehensive and flexible platform for online sales management, tailored to meet the unique needs of shop owners and their clientele.
